# Hope diff

This is the shared product definition for Hope diff. It defines what the
feature must help a person understand and what it must not claim. The harness,
plugins, skills, and future implementation must follow this file without
redefining it.

The current implementation delivers this contract through the Claude and
Codex skill. The independent harness shares collection, settings, validation,
rendering, and lifecycle code. It stops honestly before AI analysis until a
harness model adapter is added.

## Purpose

Hope diff helps a person:

1. understand what a code change changes and how;
2. judge the current change from that understanding; and
3. use that understanding in later work.

After reading the review, the person should be able to predict the result of
the change, explain its important ideas and risks, and make an informed
judgment.

Understanding belongs to the person. The review is not hidden, long-term AI
memory.

## Product boundary

Hope reviews one exact change snapshot. GitHub pull requests are the first
input, but the contract is provider-neutral. Local staged, unstaged, and
untracked files are outside the review.

The normal artifact is the only user-visible local write. Hope may use private
temporary state while it works and must remove that state at the end. Hope
creates the artifact outside the repository unless the person explicitly
selects a repository path. Hope does not merge the pull request, change other
project files, post comments, or update an external system without a separate,
explicit action.

The artifact works offline, but generation may not be local-only. Content
needed for the review is processed in the active Claude or Codex session under
the person's host and account policy. Hope must not imply that private source
stays on the local machine.

## Snapshot integrity

An exact code snapshot includes:

- the provider and repository identity;
- immutable base and head revisions; and
- the exact merge base or comparison relation used to list the change.

A branch name, pull request number, or head revision alone is not enough.

A request for the current pull request fails if its target changes during
generation. Revalidate it immediately before the completed local artifact
becomes visible. An explicitly requested historical snapshot remains valid as
history, but it must not be described as the current pull request.

Pull request text, discussions, issues, linked documents, and CI state can
change without a code revision. Bind claims from these sources to the captured
content, source identity, and collection time. Do not present them as immutable
parts of the code snapshot.

The first screen shows the reviewed head revision with the compact label
**Commit** and its capture time. A short head hash identifies that commit; it
must not be labeled as the whole snapshot. The full base, head, merge-base,
repository, and capture details remain in artifact details.

## One review artifact

The normal result is one self-contained `hope-review.html`. It explains one
snapshot. It is not a cache, task database, or second project source of truth.

The default artifact lives in a new private temporary folder. An explicit
output target must not already exist, including as a symbolic link. If it does,
leave it untouched and explain how to select a new destination.

The review never recommends approval or rejection. This remains true when a
person asks for a recommendation. Hope provides the facts, review items,
evidence, and limits needed for the person to decide.

These statements are not the same:

- “No important item was found in the checked scope” describes the review.
- “This pull request is safe to approve” is an approval recommendation and must
  not appear.

## First screen

The first screen gives the shape of the change and its limits in about 30
seconds. Show information in this order:

1. **Change purpose** — the result the change is trying to create.
2. **Core change** — a short previous and new explanation.
3. **Why it matters** — the effect on a person, caller, system, process, or
   data.
4. **Review items** — the top one to three items, or a clear empty result.
5. **Known scope limits** — each material effect, only when at least one exists.

The first screen is a short synopsis. The main explanation lives in **Core
change**. Group long lists and link to their full explanation.

Show repository and pull request identity once in the product bar. Do not
repeat it under the artifact title. Do not add a representative status, total,
or kind counts above review-item previews; each preview already names its kind
and importance. Show `No important item found in the checked scope` only when
there are no items. Show concrete material scope limits without a generic
`limited` badge, and omit the first-screen scope row when there are none. A
top-item preview contains kind, importance, and title; its explanation, effect,
action, closing condition, and evidence live in the full item.

A change may intentionally leave runtime behavior unchanged. For a refactor,
documentation change, build change, dependency update, or test-only change,
say so and explain its maintenance, development, or operational effect. Do not
invent a runtime before and after.

File counts, changed-line counts, commit counts, model names, and internal
processing facts are secondary details.

Internal reference IDs such as `source-7`, `file-2`, and `limit-1` belong only
to the analysis protocol. User-facing prose names the file, component,
behavior, or limitation instead.

## Reading order

Keep this order across reviews. Omit a conditional section when it does not
help this change.

| Order | Section | Show when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Background for understanding | Existing behavior, terms, or components are needed. |
| 2 | Core change | Always. |
| 3 | Explore the behavior | A flow, branch, state change, comparison, or experiment helps. |
| 4 | Follow the code | Selected implementation detail adds useful understanding. |
| 5 | Judge and verify | At least one actionable review item exists. |
| 6 | Check understanding | Prediction questions add learning value. |
| 7 | Evidence and checked scope | Always. |

### Background for understanding

Explain only the existing behavior, ideas, and components needed for this
change. Do not teach the whole system.

### Core change

Explain the purpose, previous state, new state, affected people or systems, and
important result. Lead with behavior or practical effect, not file names.

### Explore the behavior

Explain behavior before code. Use a flow, conditions and results, state change,
comparison, or small experiment only when it makes the result easier to
predict.

### Follow the code

Explain code in the order that creates understanding, not file-name or diff
order. Show only the excerpts needed for each step. Do not repeat the full
diff.

### Judge and verify

Show actionable review items. State what is known, why it matters, the next
step, the closing condition, and the evidence. Avoid vague warnings.

### Check understanding

Ask the reader to predict behavior, preserve an important condition, or find a
failure case. Do not ask for names, paths, or copied sentences. The quiz is not
a merge gate.

### Evidence and checked scope

Show the exact code snapshot, captured supporting sources, checked files,
material sources not checked, and resulting limits. Important evidence also
stays beside the claim it supports. This section is an index, not the only
evidence location.

Treat this dense index as an appendix. The section and each source group,
context check, scope limit, checked-file group, and artifact-detail group start
closed and can be opened independently. A direct link opens the controls needed
to reveal its target.

Do not list a changed file once as a captured patch and again as a checked
file. Join file sources to the changed-file row by stable file ID. Keep pull
request text, commit titles, and other sources without a changed-file ID in a
small separate source table.

Show checked and not-applicable context in the context group. Show a limited
context with the scope limits it accounts for instead of repeating it in both
groups. Group limits that share the same stable reason and material state,
while preserving every subject, impact, link target, and file disposition in
independently expandable details.

## Context to inspect

A diff is not always enough. Start with concrete questions:

- What did the author or change source say the goal was?
- How did the changed code work before and after?
- Can direct callers and callees handle the new state?
- Do related types, settings, tests, or examples change the meaning?
- What did CI actually run for this code snapshot?

Inspect only the relevant pull request text, commit titles, code versions, call
sites, types, settings, tests, examples, and exact-revision CI needed to answer
those questions.

When a material question remains, follow directly linked issues, specs, design
documents, discussions, one more relevant call step, migrations, schemas,
deployment settings, or project documents. Do not explore unrelated code,
unlinked history, arbitrary web results, local uncommitted changes, or similar
implementations without a grounded reason.

Compare source claims with the actual changed-file map and collected code.
When a pull request description or commit title names a file, behavior, or
verification result that the snapshot contradicts, make that mismatch an
explicit review item when it could change the reader's understanding or
decision. A smooth code explanation must not hide stale or contradictory
source text.

Keep two code-source roles distinct:

- **Change evidence** shows what this change modified.
- **Context evidence** shows unchanged code used to understand its effect.

Account for a relevant context category as checked, not applicable, or a scope
limit. An issue or discussion can support intent or context. It does not prove
runtime behavior.

## Review result

A review can contain several item kinds at once. Keep three things separate
inside the validated review model:

- all review items;
- a review status derived from their kinds; and
- a scope status derived from known limits.

Derive the review status in this order:

```text
At least one Resolve item   -> Action needed
Else, at least one Decide   -> Decision needed
Else, at least one Verify   -> More verification needed
No items                    -> No important item found in the checked scope
```

The derived status and counts support validation and future integrations. Do
not show them as a first-screen dashboard. Sort the visible item previews by
importance and action, show up to three, and link to the remaining count.
Limited scope must not hide a found item. A found item must not make the scope
look sufficient.

## Review items

Use only three user-facing kinds. Classify by the next action.

- **Resolve** — current evidence shows that a concrete change is needed.
- **Decide** — a requirement, intent, policy, or trade-off must be chosen.
- **Verify** — a test, reproduction, code check, or other source is needed to
  resolve an uncertainty.

A known risk is not always Resolve. Use Decide when accepting it is a human
trade-off. Use Verify when the risk itself is not established.

Every item identifies its kind, importance, issue, effect, next action, closing
condition, basis, and supporting evidence. A closing condition can be met by finding
a failure. The uncertainty then closes and a new Resolve item may be needed.

Do not assign a decision owner. Mention a responsible person only when a source
clearly identifies one. `CODEOWNERS` does not prove decision authority.

Importance means the effect of ignoring an item. It does not mean confidence,
effort, or item kind.

- **High** — possible security or privacy harm, data loss, core failure,
  difficult recovery, broad impact, or failure of the change's main goal.
- **Medium** — real but limited or recoverable impact, such as a conditional
  error, compatibility problem, important test gap, or maintenance cost.
- **Low** — a local issue with no effect on the core result.

Do not keep taste-based style comments as Low items. Sort by importance, then
Resolve before Decide before Verify, then closeness to the main change. Show
only the top one to three items on the first screen.

## Evidence and uncertainty

Use one basis vocabulary for important claims:

- **Stated in source**
- **Shown in code**
- **Observed in execution**
- **Inferred from evidence**
- **Could not confirm**

A purpose uses **Stated in source**, **Inferred from evidence**, or **Could not
confirm**. Always show the exact source, such as the pull request description or
a commit message. Do not assign a statement to the pull request author unless
that identity is established.

Show a basis for each purpose, important behavior or effect claim, review item,
execution result, inference, and uncertainty. Ordinary connecting sentences do
not need a badge.

Keep the short basis beside the claim. Let the reader expand it to see its
source type, identity or path, capture time when needed, and a small excerpt.
Each review item has its own evidence control.

One evidence excerpt contains at most 24 lines. Reuse a stable evidence target
when several claims cite the same source range instead of embedding the same
code repeatedly.

Keep these boundaries clear:

- Pull request text supports a stated goal, not actual behavior.
- Code supports an implementation claim, not an execution result.
- A test or execution supports observed conditions, not every condition.
- An excerpt must support every material part of the claim that cites it.

**Observed in execution** is reserved for a trusted execution or exact-revision
CI record collected by Hope. The current model-authored analysis cannot create
that basis.

Do not repeat one concern as both a review item and a question. A scope limit is
an inspection-boundary fact. Add a Verify item only when a concrete, useful
follow-up can resolve the uncertainty. The analysis references that limit by
its internal ID, and the renderer creates the user-facing link. The item
describes the action instead of restating the limit.

## Coverage and failure

A generated review has one of two scope statuses:

- **Scope sufficient** — no known omission limits a main explanation or
  judgment.
- **Scope limited** — at least one known omission limits a main explanation or
  judgment.

“Scope sufficient” does not mean Hope checked the whole repository, runtime,
discussion, or every possible execution.

Each scope limit states what Hope could not check, why, and what Hope therefore
cannot explain or judge.

The collector records every known unchecked input. The analysis marks whether
each omission materially limits a main explanation or judgment and explains
why. Only material omissions make the user-facing status **Scope limited**.
Non-material omissions remain visible in checked-scope details so they cannot
disappear silently.

Account for every provider-reported changed file once as explained, supporting,
mechanical, metadata-only, or redacted. A readable safe-text file must be
explained, supporting, or mechanical. No file may disappear silently.

Detected truncation, incomplete pagination, or a partial body counts as
unavailable content. It cannot count as a fully inspected file.

When GitHub does not provide a text diff for a zero-line change, record the
file as metadata-only without requesting its body. When a body is larger than
Hope's safe text limit, record that deliberate safety boundary as
metadata-only instead of treating the file as inspected or aborting an
otherwise grounded review. Both omissions remain visible and the analysis must
state whether they limit a main explanation or judgment.

A limited review can be created only when:

- the complete changed-file list is known;
- every readable changed file was fully collected and inspected;
- every unavailable body has a known, deliberate reason;
- checked and unchecked information stay separate;
- every claim stays within checked evidence; and
- missing information does not prevent a grounded explanation of the core
  change.

The review fails when discovery or required collection is incomplete, a
readable changed file was not inspected, the current target changed, Hope
cannot tell what is missing, or the core change cannot be explained from the
available evidence.

On failure, explain the cause and next step. Do not create or expose an
incomplete review, and do not replace an older valid artifact.

## Teaching aids

Use a visual, interactive model, or quiz only when it makes a relationship
materially easier to understand. Each aid needs a distinct teaching job.

Use a flow for a sequence, a decision table for meaningful branches, a
sequence view for ordered interaction, and a component map for structure. A
visual clarifies prose; it does not decorate the page.

The review may contain one optional microworld as a visually separate **Try
it** block inside **Explore the behavior**.

Use a microworld when changing an input, condition, or state helps the reader
predict the result. State what evidence grounds it, what it simplifies, and
what it leaves out. The self-contained HTML uses a safe explanation model. It
does not execute repository code or present its output as a test result.

An experiment that executes real code belongs to the harness, not this offline
artifact. It needs its own isolated execution boundary.

Use one optional quiz with three to five evidence-backed questions only when
prediction adds value. Give each answer a self-check explanation and evidence
link. Do not add an aggregate score or pass threshold.

## Optional verification

Test, build, and lint results can strengthen a review, but are not required for
every review.

Prefer exact-revision CI, then a targeted test, then lint or typecheck, and a
full test or build only when needed. Identify the revision and source tree that
actually ran. A synthetic merge result is not a head-revision result. A dirty,
stale, or different tree cannot confirm a claim about the reviewed snapshot.

Treat every repository-controlled command as untrusted, including standard
test scripts. Run it only in an enforced disposable environment without ambient
secrets, external writes, or network access. If Hope cannot enforce that
boundary, ask for explicit approval of the concrete exposure and effects or do
not run it.

Normal read-only provider collection uses the authenticated host session.
Consent in this section applies to optional command execution and new external
effects.

Record the command, executed revision, environment, and result. Distinguish not
run, passed, failed, environment or tool failure, and a stale result. “Failed”
means the intended check ran and reported failure. Setup, runner, and
infrastructure problems do not prove a product failure.

Hope must not claim a test, build, lint, or CI result that it did not observe.

## Sharing and interaction

The first version supports shared understanding without becoming another work
tracker.

Provide one shareable HTML artifact, consistent terms, and stable section and
evidence IDs inside that artifact. The first local-only version does not show
a section-copy control because its temporary path is not portable.

The review may let a person expand evidence, open a code location, use a
microworld, and answer a quiz. The person can then share the artifact through
an existing team space such as GitHub or Notion.

Do not add Hope comments, assignments, completion state, checkboxes, or a task
database. Do not publish automatically. A future publish action must be
explicit and show the exact content and destination before changing an
external system.

## Language and design

This file owns the diff review's information order and meaning.
[design.md](design.md) owns Hope's shared visual language.

The review uses one resolved locale:

1. an explicit one-run override;
2. the saved Hope setting;
3. a host or operating-system locale when no setting exists; or
4. `en-US`.

The first supported locales are `ko-KR` and `en-US`. An ordinary request written
in another language does not replace a saved setting. A one-run override does
not update the setting. Changing the locale of an existing artifact requires a
new review.

Do not show a language badge in the header. Record the resolved locale and its
source in artifact details, set the HTML `lang`, and show a visible warning only
when Hope used a fallback.

Translate fixed labels through trusted shared locale files. Preserve titles,
paths, commands, code, and excerpts exactly. Generated explanations use the
resolved locale while keeping necessary source terms unchanged.

The review starts with the resolved `system`, `light`, or `dark` theme. Its
theme control changes only the open document and does not write Hope settings
or browser storage.

## Trust and lifecycle

Treat provider data, repository content, paths, excerpts, model output, and
URLs as untrusted.

The user-visible guarantees are:

- untrusted content stays inert;
- the artifact is self-contained and offline;
- the artifact never executes repository code;
- provider links use validated identity and trusted origins;
- an existing output is never overwritten;
- incomplete or stale current-target reviews are not exposed as current; and
- the same versioned and validated inputs render to the same bytes.

Revalidate a current target immediately before a completed local artifact
becomes visible and again before a later external publish action. If the check
fails, do not expose a new final artifact or change the external destination.

Remove private collection and model files after normal success, failure, or
cooperative cancellation. A process crash or forced termination can prevent
immediate cleanup. Each run therefore needs an ownership record, restrictive
permissions, and safe expiry cleanup on a later Hope invocation. Never infer
ownership from a directory name alone.

A failed analysis validation may keep the private run for one explicit repair
attempt. The next validation failure is terminal and removes it.

The HTML is a view of one snapshot. After the pull request changes, its current
status is unknown until an external comparison is made. Durable project
knowledge is a separate, explicit workflow.

## Source and Hope decisions

This contract was influenced by Geoffrey Litt's
[Understanding is the new bottleneck](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2026/07/02/understanding-is-the-new-bottleneck.html).
The related
[recorded talk](https://youtu.be/x3e_Yl4NNHY)
is also a direct source. These sources support background before detail,
intuition before code, literate diffs, prediction questions, microworlds, and
shared understanding.

Hope owns the product rules in this contract, including no approval
recommendation, the review and scope states, evidence language, failure
behavior, the offline artifact boundary, and the initial sharing scope.
